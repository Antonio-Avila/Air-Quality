# Texas Air Quality Analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze how the air quality has changed from 2017 until 2021 (will update to 2022 when possible) by looking into 2 key pollutants: ozone and pm2.5.

By analyzing the pollutant dataset, I hope to get an insight into the environmental effect the March 2020 lockdown had on pollution levels.

Moreover, I am interested in determining if there is a relationship between pollutant levels and the number of severe COVID cases. Meaning, do areas with regular high pollution levels have a higher number of severe COVID cases.

### Interactive Web App:
Please follow this link to view an interactive map displaying pollutant (ozone and pm2.5) data for counties in Texas in a given day. I plan on updating it soon to display COVID data.

### Current Phase:
Currently, I am preparing Texas's COVID data for analysis to include in the interactive web app and to determine if there is a relationship with the pollutant levels.
