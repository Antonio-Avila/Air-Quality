# Texas Air Quality Analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze how the air quality has changed from 2017 until 2021 (will update to 2022 when possible) by looking into 2 key pollutants: ozone and pm2.5.

By analyzing the pollutant dataset, I hope to get an insight into the environmental effect the March 2020 lockdown had on pollution levels.

Moreover, I am interested in determining if there is a relationship between pollutant levels and the number of severe COVID cases. Meaning, do areas with regular high pollution levels have a higher number of severe COVID cases.
